[in one academic semester](https://github.com/susannalles/MinimalEditions/blob/master/README.md),
while allowing us to care for our projects at less cost, and perhaps, just perhaps, to generate
high-quality editions on github.io in large quantities based on the
[git-lit](http://jonreeve.com/2015/09/introducing-git-lit/) model by Jonathan Reeve. We're coming
for you, Kindle!
